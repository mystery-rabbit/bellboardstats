"""
Python script to parse Bellboard QP stats.

Target: Leicestershire Ringers

So firstly - look on the "Features" page and you can see a Leading Ringers search option that accepts an 
"association" .. in which case this is your Leading QP Ringers for LDG 2023 - and so you can edit the URL
 accordingly to get 2022 etc.
https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/leading-ringers.php?association_id=17&association=Leicester+Diocesan+Guild&year=2023&annual_totals&length=quarter

But.. that's not what you're presenting in your data so then i assumed it was QPs in leicestershire which 
if we note that a general search URL looks like this... 
https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/search.php?region=leicestershire&year=2023&length=quarter

then we might guess that by combining the two URLs above we get:
https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/leading-ringers.php?region=leicestershire&year=2023&annual_totals&length=quarter

which whilst it works is still not matching what you presented since you seem to be generating stats for 
"leicestershire ringers".

and that's the issue - I don't think you can do that easily since bellboard has no concept that matches 
your criteria of a "leicestershire" ringer - ie: the vast majority of Alistair's QPs were rung out of 
county and out of guild. 

Robert Response:
I should have been clearer in what I was looking for though you worked it out though by a process of elimination: 
I was looking for all quarters rung by LDG/Leicestershire ringers, wherever they rang them (when I did the analysis 
last year I thought this would help my ranking, but I was wrong).  The fundamental problem in what I wanted to do is 
that I don't have a list of all LDG/Leicestershire ringers, so I adopted a two-step process - I looked for leading 
ringers by association (as you did first) and then searched individually for each of thech  top 20 ringers to see how 
many they had rung in total.  I guess that is a hard searcriteria to code upâ€¦.  Alistair inevitably jumped over me 
because he rings quite a few in Northamptonshire and goes on quarter peal trips.  

API Docs:
https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/help/api.php
- query-type: application/xml will return xml

Steps: 
Get list of ringers by assoc:
https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/leading-ringers.php?association_id=17&association=Leicester+Diocesan+Guild&year=2023&annual_totals&length=quarter
Then get the list by county
combine, and de-duplicate.
produce stats for county, guild and an XOR of both.

then query for personal totals:
https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/search.php?year=2024&annual_totals&length=quarter&ringer=%22Moira+Johnson%22
